### Study Notes of Hanseul Kim about Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto

## Abstract

Since the age of [Alpha Go](https://deepmind.google/research/breakthroughs/alphago/), Reinforcement Learning(**RL**) was popularized with application to diverse learning system such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback([RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)) to real world robots and finace application. These Deep Reinforcement Learning application heavly rely on robust [functional approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04161) of deep neural network and learning capability using larger, [scalable models](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/performance) and huge amounts of dataset for generalization. However, to make a true generalist intelligent agent with human-like inference capability, data and computational efficient learning/planning algorithms must be well studied. This page is dedicated for deeper understanding of baseline RL algoirthms using "*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
